# Hygi0Quizz
*A Quiz Game in [HTML/Javascript-jQuery] to train people to hygiene recommendations*

## Explanation
The purpose of this application is to easily learn hygiene recommendations of the structure you work at.  
I noticed that application of hygiene measures at work by operators is something hard because of 3 things
1) The learning of the hygiene recommendations of the structure by the operators, that could be hard and unpleasing
2) The discordance between theorical cases and reality, when the scale of values of the recommendations doesn't meet the operators' ones
3) The logistical difficulty of applying the recommandations, due to lack of time or resources

This application has the purpose to solve the first point by decreasing the constraint to overcome to learn the recommendations, this by using concretes situation and trial and error learning strategy, on a funny web application.
This also have the purpose to affect positively the second point by encourage dialog between operators and hygiene team about specific hygiene cases, problems encountered in the unit, scales of values, etc.
